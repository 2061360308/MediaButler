# Whitelist Configuration - Secure Bot

## How Security Works

The bot now has a **whitelist** system that allows access only to authorized users.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (First Time)

### 1. Start the bot WITHOUT changing anything
```bash
python telegram_media_bot_secure.py
```

### 2. Go to Telegram and use `/start`
The bot will reply with:
```
🔐 First access - Admin Mode
You have been added as administrator!
Your ID: 123456789

To add other users, edit AUTHORIZED_USERS in the code.
```

### 3. Copy your ID and add it to the code
Open the file and edit this section:
```python
AUTHORIZED_USERS = [
    123456789,  # Your ID (replace with the real one)
]
```

### 4. Restart the bot
Now only you can use it!

## 👥 Add Other Users

### Method 1: Ask for their ID
1. Have the new user try to use `/start`
2. The bot will show them their ID in the error message
3. Add that ID to the list:

```python
AUTHORIZED_USERS = [
    123456789,  # Giovanni (admin)
    987654321,  # Mario
    555555555,  # Anna
]
```

### Method 2: Use the `/users` command
Only the admin (first user) can see the full list of authorized users.

## 🔐 Security Features

### For all authorized users:
- ✅ Can download files
- ✅ Can use all basic commands
- ✅ Can manage their own downloads

### Only for the admin (first user):
- 👑 Can use `/stop` to stop the bot
- 👑 Can see `/users` for the full list
- 👑 Can decide who to add

### Additional protections:
- ❌ Unauthorized users see "Access Denied"
- ❌ They cannot click on buttons
- ❌ Every attempt is logged
- ✅ Each user can only manage their own downloads

## 📝 Multi-user Configuration Example

```python
# Family
AUTHORIZED_USERS = [
    123456789,  # Giovanni (admin)
    987654321,  # Partner
    555555555,  # Brother
]

# Personal only
AUTHORIZED_USERS = [
    123456789,  # Only me
]

# Test with trusted friends
AUTHORIZED_USERS = [
    123456789,  # Giovanni (admin)
    111111111,  # Marco
    222222222,  # Luca
]
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **The first user is always the admin** - has extra privileges
2. **Backup the list** - if you lose the IDs, you'll have to start over
3. **Do not share the file** with the list of IDs
4. **Change the bot's username** if you want extra security

## 🛡️ Extra Security (Optional)

For even more security, you can:

1. **Change the bot's username** in BotFather:
   ```
   /setname
   Choose: @mediabot_x7k9p2m_2024_bot
   ```

2. **Never share** the bot link

3. **Monitor the logs** for access attempts:
   ```bash
   grep "unauthorized" bot.log
   ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I lost my admin ID"**
- Delete `AUTHORIZED_USERS = [...]` (leave it empty)
- Restart the bot
- Use `/start` - you will become admin again

**"I want to remove a user"**
- Remove their ID from the list
- Restart the bot

**"The bot says I am not authorized"**
- Check that your ID is in the list
- Make sure there are no wrong spaces or commas
- Restart the bot after changes
